Greetings!

First of all, thank you for giving me this opportunity. Despite facing some challenges during development, I was able to complete the task on time. I enjoyed the whole process. I have added additional transformations and a pricing table. Please ignore the content of the pricing table, as it was used for demonstration purposes. I also made some UI changes, which I believe will be more effective.

I look forward to hearing from you and am hopeful to join your team.

Best regards,
Aqila M
